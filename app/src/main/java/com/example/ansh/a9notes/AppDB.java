/*
SINGLETON PATTERN:In software engineering, the singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts
the instantiation of a class to one object. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to
coordinate actions across the system. The concept is sometimes generalized to systems that operate
more efficiently when only one object exists, or that restrict the instantiation to a certain number
of objects. The term comes from the mathematical concept of a singleton.

/*  MISC:NAMING CONVENTIONS
* - data.java : works as a class 1)defining structure of data 2)defining column names 3) defining
*               table names . :. classname=DBEntryStructure.java BUT entity(tablename= "AllNotes"+"table"
*               i.e,
*                @Entity(tableName = "AllnotesTable")
*                public class DBEntryStructure {
*                    ...
*                    ...
*                    }
* - DAO(functions waala interface) : works as an interface providing functions for the class. :.
*                @Dao public interface "AllNotes"+TableFunctions {...}
* - Database : AppDB because this shows puri app ke liye ek hi db banega BUT iska object "ALLnotes.db
*              ke name se banaege
*
